                                    <h3>For Device/Computer Security</h3>
                                    <p><ol><li> Keep your antivirus and operating system updated at all times.</li>
                                        <li>Backup your sensitive/important data at regular intervals.</li>
                                        <li> Be careful while opening suspicious web links/URLs.</li>
                                        <li> Always scan external storage devices (e.g. USB) for viruses, while connecting to your device.</li>
                                        <li>To prevent unauthorized access to your device, consider activating your wireless router's MAC 
                                       address filter to allow authorized devices only.</li>
                                        <li>Wireless router can screen the MAC addresses of all devices connected to it, and users can set their 
                                       wireless network to accept connections only from devices with MAC addresses recognized by the 
                                       router.</li>
                                        <li> Secure all your wireless access points with a strong password. Hackers usually scan for open access 
                                       points and may misuse it to carry out unwanted activities. Log records may make you more vulnerable 
                                       for such misuse.</li>
                                        <li>Merely deleting sensitive material is not sufficient, as it does not actually remove the data from your 
                                       device. "File Shredder Software‟ should be used to delete sensitive files on computers.</li>
                                        <li>Delete unwanted files or data from your computer device. It prevents unauthorized access to such data 
                                       by others.</li>
                                    <li>Use "Non-Administrator Account‟ privileges for login to the computer and avoid accessing with 
                                       "Administrator‟ privileges for day-to-day usage of computers.</li>
                                        <li>Make sure to install reputed mobile anti-virus protection to protect your mobile from prevalent cyber 
                                       threats and also keep it updated.</li>
                                        <li>In case of loss or theft of your mobile device, immediately get your SIM deactivated and change 
                                       passwords of all your accounts, which were configured on that mobile.</li>
                                        <li>Do not leave your phone unattended in public places and refrain from sharing your phone password/ 
                                       pattern lock with anybody.</li>
                                        <li>Always enable a password on the home screen to restrict unauthorized access to your mobile phone. 
                                       Configure your device to automatically lock beyond a particular duration.</li>
                                        <li> Always lock your computer before leaving your workplace to prevent unauthorized access. A user can 
                                       lock one's computer by pressing "Ctrl +Alt + Del‟ and choosing "Lock this Computer‟ or “Window 
                                       button+ L”.</li>
                                        <li> Remove unnecessary programs or services from computer which are not required for day to day 
                                       operation.</li></ol></p>

                                                                to government charity funds, requesting money for victims, products or research. Always check the
