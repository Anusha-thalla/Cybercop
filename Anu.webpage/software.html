                        <h3>OTP SHARING FRAUD :</h3>
                    <p>Cyber criminals posing themselves as bank /RBI officials call people and tell them that 
                        their ATM card has been blocked or their KYC (Know Your Customer) is not updated 
                        or their Aadhaar is not linked to their bank account & hence their account will be 
                        blocked. Then on the pretext of updating the KYC/linking bank account to Aadhaar or 
                        for resuming the services of ATM card/activation of new ATM card asks for details 
                        related to victim‟s bank account like ATM card number, CVV number, OTP etc. After 
                        these details are shared by victim, money is siphoned off from the victim‟s bank 
                        account.</p>

                        <h4>precautions</h4>
                        <ol><li> Remember bank never asks for card number/CVV number/OTP.
                            <li>Never share the ATM card number, CVV, OTP or any other confidential banking 
                            credentials with anyone over a phone call/SMS/WhatsApp.</li>
                             <li>E-mail should not be shared as this may lead to activation of Internet banking by 
                            cyber criminals, leading to siphoning off of one‟s money.</li></ol>
                        <h3>UPI PHISHING FRAUD :
                            </h3>
                        <p>On the pretext of helping in banking related issues, fraudsters ask victims to forward an
                            alphanumeric link to a particular number (depending upon the bank associated with the
                            victim) from their registered mobile number. Once it is done, cyber criminals install the
                            UPI wallet of the victim (using Wi-Fi) bypassing the SIM binding process onto their own
                            mobile phone, thus gaining access to the victim‟s bank accounts linked to the registered
                            mobile number.</p>
                            <img src="page-0006.jpg" alt="Anu">

                                bank /RBI officials.</li> 
                                <li> calling to customer care number of airlines/e-commerce entities obtained 
                                from Google search for rescheduling flights/getting refunds etc. have become 
                                victims of such frauds following their instructions. Never do that. </li></ol>
                            <h3>FRAUD BY REQUEST MONEY QR CODE/LINK ON GOOGLE
                                PAY/PHONEPE/PAYTM :</h3>
                                <p>Cyber fraudsters send debit links or QR codes to victims to scan and receive money in
                                    their bank accounts through Google Pay/PhonePe/Paytm. But instead of receiving money,
                                    it actually gets debited from the victim‟s account as fraudsters actually send a request
                                    money QR code/link.</p>
                                    <img src="page-0007.jpg" alt="amma">

                                    <ol><li> Never accept/click on any link or scan any QR code from unverified sources as 
                                        they may send you a manipulated one.</li> 
                                        <li> For receiving money, there is no need to enter MPIN or UPI PIN. </li></ol>

                                    <p>Apps for online forms like Google Docs etc. are widely used to collect data. Fraudsters take
                                        advantage of such applications and misguide the victim to fill or submit his/her confidential
                                        bank related data like ATM number, UPI PIN, password etc. As soon as they fill up the
                                        form and submit their data, it is directly transferred to the creator of the form.
                                        </p>

                                            <li>Bank never asks their customers to fill such forms. </li></ol>
                                        <h3>FRAUD USING OLX/E-COMMERCE PLATFORMS :
                                        </h3>
                                        <p>Cyber fraudster uses the e-commerce platforms like Olx/Quikr/Facebook for giving fake
                                            advertisements to sell commodity at lucrative prices. When someone intends to buy, cyber
                                            fraudster asks for advance payment in the form of packaging/transportation/registration
                                            charges etc. Buyer pays the money believing him/her to be a real seller and the fraudster
                                            disappears with the money. Frauds are also committed by cyber criminals posing
                                            themselves as buyers to real sellers. In this modus operandi, cyber criminals get the
                                            seller‟s account debited on the pretext of paying advance money by sending request
                                            money link/QR code instead of the credit link/QR code</p>

                                            <p>Fraudsters lure victims by offering cashback offers from PhonePe/Google Pay etc. and

                                                Once the link is clicked or QR code is scanned, money is debited from the victim‟s bank
                                                account instead of being credited as he enters MPIN or UPI PIN. Link can be of type
