<h1>ABOUT CYBER CRIMES </h1>
 <p> Advanced technologies have changed the modern way of life. The 
                        internet provides us with many benefits. Be it communicating with friends, searching for 
                        information, doing banking transactions, availing online services, finding job, finding life 
                        partner or even running entire businesses. The internet touches almost all aspects of our 
                        lives. However, it also makes us vulnerable to a wide range of threats. New and powerful 
                        cyber-attacks are striking the internet regularly. A minor lapse in managing our digital lives 
                        can open the door to cyber criminals. Cyber criminals can steal our money or damage our 
                        reputation. According to a study by a leading industry research organization, 90% of all 
                        cyber attacks are caused by human negligence. Therefore, cyber security awareness is 
                        important for everyone today. 
                        We must be vigilant while making use of technology to reduce the risk of cyber threats. </p>

                <h3>OTP SHARING FRAUD :</h3>
                <p>Cyber criminals posing themselves as bank /RBI officials call people and tell them that 
                    their ATM card has been blocked or their KYC (Know Your Customer) is not updated 
                    or their Aadhaar is not linked to their bank account & hence their account will be 
                    blocked. Then on the pretext of updating the KYC/linking bank account to Aadhaar or 
                    for resuming the services of ATM card/activation of new ATM card asks for details 
                    related to victim‟s bank account like ATM card number, CVV number, OTP etc. After 
                    these details are shared by victim, money is siphoned off from the victim‟s bank 
                    account.</p>
                    <img src="page-0005.jpg" alt="amma">
                    <h4>precautions</h4>
                    <ol><li> Remember bank never asks for card number/CVV number/OTP.
                        <li>Never share the ATM card number, CVV, OTP or any other confidential banking 
                        credentials with anyone over a phone call/SMS/WhatsApp.</li>
                         <li>E-mail should not be shared as this may lead to activation of Internet banking by 
                        cyber criminals, leading to siphoning off of one‟s money.</li></ol>
                    <h3>UPI PHISHING FRAUD :
                        </h3>
                    <p>On the pretext of helping in banking related issues, fraudsters ask victims to forward an
                        alphanumeric link to a particular number (depending upon the bank associated with the
                        victim) from their registered mobile number. Once it is done, cyber criminals install the
                        UPI wallet of the victim (using Wi-Fi) bypassing the SIM binding process onto their own
                        mobile phone, thus gaining access to the victim‟s bank accounts linked to the registered
                        mobile number.</p>

                            bank /RBI officials.</li> 
                            <li> calling to customer care number of airlines/e-commerce entities obtained 
                            from Google search for rescheduling flights/getting refunds etc. have become 
                            victims of such frauds following their instructions. Never do that. </li></ol>
                        <h3>FRAUD BY REQUEST MONEY QR CODE/LINK ON GOOGLE
                            PAY/PHONEPE/PAYTM :</h3>
                            <p>Cyber fraudsters send debit links or QR codes to victims to scan and receive money in
                                their bank accounts through Google Pay/PhonePe/Paytm. But instead of receiving money,
                                it actually gets debited from the victim‟s account as fraudsters actually send a request
                                money QR code/link.</p>

                                <p>Apps for online forms like Google Docs etc. are widely used to collect data. Fraudsters take
                                    advantage of such applications and misguide the victim to fill or submit his/her confidential
                                    bank related data like ATM number, UPI PIN, password etc. As soon as they fill up the
                                    form and submit their data, it is directly transferred to the creator of the form.
                                    </p>

                                        <li>Bank never asks their customers to fill such forms. </li></ol>
                                    <h3>FRAUD USING OLX/E-COMMERCE PLATFORMS :
                                    </h3>
                                    <p>Cyber fraudster uses the e-commerce platforms like Olx/Quikr/Facebook for giving fake
                                        advertisements to sell commodity at lucrative prices. When someone intends to buy, cyber
                                        fraudster asks for advance payment in the form of packaging/transportation/registration
                                        charges etc. Buyer pays the money believing him/her to be a real seller and the fraudster
                                        disappears with the money. Frauds are also committed by cyber criminals posing
                                        themselves as buyers to real sellers. In this modus operandi, cyber criminals get the
                                        seller‟s account debited on the pretext of paying advance money by sending request
                                        money link/QR code instead of the credit link/QR code</p>

                                            seller in person. </li>
                                        <li>For receiving any type of payment via link or QR code, there is no need to enter

                                    <li>Always remember entering MPIN or UPI PIN is required only for paying money. </li></ol>
                                        <h3>FRAUD THROUGH FAKE CASHBACK OFFERS :</h3>
                                        <p>Fraudsters lure victims by offering cashback offers from PhonePe/Google Pay etc. and
                                            request the victims to click on a request money link or scan a QR code to avail the same.
                                            Once the link is clicked or QR code is scanned, money is debited from the victim‟s bank
                                            account instead of being credited as he enters MPIN or UPI PIN. Link can be of type

                                                <li>Remember the thumb rule: You need to enter MPIN or UPI PIN only for debiting 
                                                money from your account; it is never required for receiving money. </li></ol>

                                            </h3>
                                            <p>Cyber fraudsters on the pretext of aiding or citing the policy of a company guide the

                                                thus get control of the victim‟s phone, thereby getting access to banking credentials like
                                                OTP/MPIN/username/password for internet banking etc. The fraudster then siphons off
                                                money from the victim‟s account using those credentials. By the time the victim realizes

                    <p>Fraudsters target accounts on popular social media platforms like Facebook and 
                     Instagram. They commit fraud by creating a similar fake account of the target profile and 
                     requesting his/her friends for instant money transfer citing some medical emergency etc. 
                     Target profile‟s friends transfer the money considering him/her as his/her friend. By the 
                     time the target profile comes to know of it, many of his friends become victims of the 
                     fraud. Similar fraud is also committed by hacking the target account. </p>

         <p>Each ATM/debit card has a magnetic strip in it containing confidential data. Cyber 
             criminals use a skimmer machine to read this strip and capture the confidential data related 
             to the card. Then they copy the data onto a blank card, which is used for fraudulent 
             transactions. They use overlay devices/pin-hole camera/ spy camera or peep from behind 
             in the queue to read ATM/Debit card PIN while it is being entered by the user on the ATM 
             keypad/POS machines. </p>

                 <li>Do not allow anyone to stand beside or behind you while carrying out transaction 
                 with ATM/Debit card/Credit card. </li>
                 <li>Do not keep a PIN which can be guessed easily. Keep changing your PIN. </li>
                 <li>Ensure you get transaction receipt or confirmation through SMS.</li> 
                 <li> Ensure that any part of the ATM machine is open or loosely attached. </li></ol>
             <h3>EDITED GOOGLE CUSTOMER CARE NUMBER FRAUD</h3>
             <p>Cyber fraudsters edit the customer care number of banks/airlines/food outlets/e- 
                 commerce entities etc. on Google page and customize it in such a manner that whenever 
                 someone searches on Google for the customer care number, the edited number of cyber 
                 criminals appears on top of the search results for that entity. Victim ends up calling the 
                 fraudsters instead of the real helpline numbers. The fraudsters portraying themselves as 
                 helpers actually give instructions to dupe the caller victim. </p>

                     banks/airlines/food or retail outlets/other e-commerce entity and not by searching 
                     the entity name on Google search. </li>
                     <li>Toll free number for any bank is given on back/flip side of debit/credit card. Call 
                     on the given numbers only. </li>

                     functionality of a computer in some way. The ransomware program displays a message 
                     that demands payment to restore functionality. The malware, in effect, holds the computer 
                     system to ransom. In other words, ransomware is an extortion racket. Ransomware 
                     typically spreads through phishing emails or by unknowingly visiting an infected website. </p>

            <h3>LOTTERY FRAUD/NIGERIAN FRAUD</h3>
            <p>Cyber fraudsters send e-mails/SMSs informing the recipient (victim) that he/she has won 
             a lottery/prize worth millions of rupees/dollars and the recipient only needs to click on 
             the link sent on their e-mail/mobile phone or to tell how they want to receive the prize 
             money. However, on responding positively, the recipient is asked to pay money in the 
             name of registration/shipment/service charges, GST etc. one after the other for releasing 
             the prize money. This way the recipient keeps on paying the fraudsters until he/she 
             realizes the fraud. The fraudsters were initially mainly from Nigeria and hence the 
             terminology.</p>

                 promise of higher returns/winning prizes or lottery. </li></ol>
             <h3>ONLINE JOB FRAUD</h3>
             <p>Cyber criminals advertise fake job offers using various platforms either online via fake 
                 websites. Victim, in search of a job, goes through these fake job offers and contacts the 
                 cyber criminal. Upon contacting cyber criminals, victim is asked to pay registration fee 
                 or make an advance payment (which they claim is refundable) to avail their services for 
                 getting a job. Victim transfers the money and follows the guidelines of the fraudster for 
                 getting a job and falls prey to the cyber crime. In some cases, a fake website phishes 
                 financial data through a fake payment channel. </p>

         have viruses which pass sensitive information or give control of your phone/device to 
         some outside agent, who gets access to your contacts, passwords, financial data etc. 
         Several mobile applications from unknown sources ask for unnecessary permissions for 
         access to your phone/device, which one grants without due diligence. Thus, these mobile 
         applications can access a huge amount of personal information, photographs etc. from 
         your phone/device. </p> 
         <img src="page-0027.jpg" alt="">
         <h4>precautions</h4>
        <ol><li>Always install applications from trusted sources like for Android devices, use 
         Google Play, for Apple devices use App Store. Please ensure that the app is 
         having Play Protect shield.</li> 
     <li> It is also important to read reviews about the app. If it has a negative review, read 
         more to see if anybody noted any security concerns like bugs or unencrypted 
         passwords. </li>
     <li>Update your software and mobile applications on a regular basis so that you don‟t 
         miss on important security patches. </li>
     <li>Be careful while granting app permissions like a document scanning app does not 
         require permission to access your location, call logs etc. Sometimes applications 
         are filled with spyware and other types of malware. </li></ol></section>

                                    <h2>Safety Tips that are helpful to avoid cyber Crimes</h2>
                                    <h3>For Device/Computer Security</h3>
                                    <p><ol><li> Keep your antivirus and operating system updated at all times.</li>
                                        <li>Backup your sensitive/important data at regular intervals.</li>
                                        <li> Be careful while opening suspicious web links/URLs.</li>
                                        <li> Always scan external storage devices (e.g. USB) for viruses, while connecting to your device.</li>
                                        <li>To prevent unauthorized access to your device, consider activating your wireless router's MAC 
                                       address filter to allow authorized devices only.</li>
                                        <li>Wireless router can screen the MAC addresses of all devices connected to it, and users can set their 
                                       wireless network to accept connections only from devices with MAC addresses recognized by the 
                                       router.</li>
                                        <li> Secure all your wireless access points with a strong password. Hackers usually scan for open access 
                                       points and may misuse it to carry out unwanted activities. Log records may make you more vulnerable 
                                       for such misuse.</li>
                                        <li>Merely deleting sensitive material is not sufficient, as it does not actually remove the data from your 
                                       device. "File Shredder Software‟ should be used to delete sensitive files on computers.</li>
                                        <li>Delete unwanted files or data from your computer device. It prevents unauthorized access to such data 
                                       by others.</li>
                                    <li>Use "Non-Administrator Account‟ privileges for login to the computer and avoid accessing with 
                                       "Administrator‟ privileges for day-to-day usage of computers.</li>
                                        <li>Make sure to install reputed mobile anti-virus protection to protect your mobile from prevalent cyber 
                                       threats and also keep it updated.</li>
                                        <li>In case of loss or theft of your mobile device, immediately get your SIM deactivated and change 
                                       passwords of all your accounts, which were configured on that mobile.</li>
                                        <li>Do not leave your phone unattended in public places and refrain from sharing your phone password/ 
                                       pattern lock with anybody.</li>
                                        <li>Always enable a password on the home screen to restrict unauthorized access to your mobile phone. 
                                       Configure your device to automatically lock beyond a particular duration.</li>
                                        <li> Always lock your computer before leaving your workplace to prevent unauthorized access. A user can 
                                       lock one's computer by pressing "Ctrl +Alt + Del‟ and choosing "Lock this Computer‟ or “Window 
                                       button+ L”.</li>
                                        <li> Remove unnecessary programs or services from computer which are not required for day to day 
                                       operation.</li></ol></p>
