                                <h3>ATM/DEBIT CARD CLONING FRAUD</h3> 
                                <p>Each ATM/debit card has a magnetic strip in it containing confidential data. Cyber 
                                    criminals use a skimmer machine to read this strip and capture the confidential data related 
                                    to the card. Then they copy the data onto a blank card, which is used for fraudulent 
                                    transactions. They use overlay devices/pin-hole camera/ spy camera or peep from behind 
                                    in the queue to read ATM/Debit card PIN while it is being entered by the user on the ATM 
                                    keypad/POS machines. </p>

                                        <li>Physically check the keypad to ensure it does not have an overlay device.</li> 
                                        <li>Do not allow anyone to stand beside or behind you while carrying out transaction 
                                        with ATM/Debit card/Credit card. </li>
                                        <li>Do not keep a PIN which can be guessed easily. Keep changing your PIN. </li>

                                    <h3>EDITED GOOGLE CUSTOMER CARE NUMBER FRAUD</h3>
                                    <p>Cyber fraudsters edit the customer care number of banks/airlines/food outlets/e- 
                                        commerce entities etc. on Google page and customize it in such a manner that whenever 
                                        someone searches on Google for the customer care number, the edited number of cyber 
                                        criminals appears on top of the search results for that entity. Victim ends up calling the 
                                        fraudsters instead of the real helpline numbers. The fraudsters portraying themselves as 
                                        helpers actually give instructions to dupe the caller victim. </p>

                                            banks/airlines/food or retail outlets/other e-commerce entity and not by searching 
                                            the entity name on Google search. </li>
                                            <li>Toll free number for any bank is given on back/flip side of debit/credit card. Call 
                                            on the given numbers only. </li>

                                        <h3>RANSOMWARE ATTACKS</h3>
                                        <p>Ransomware is a category of malicious software which, when run, disables the 
                                            functionality of a computer in some way. The ransomware program displays a message 
                                            that demands payment to restore functionality. The malware, in effect, holds the computer 
                                            system to ransom. In other words, ransomware is an extortion racket. Ransomware 
                                            typically spreads through phishing emails or by unknowingly visiting an infected website. </p>

                                   <h3>LOTTERY FRAUD/NIGERIAN FRAUD</h3>
                                   <p>Cyber fraudsters send e-mails/SMSs informing the recipient (victim) that he/she has won 
                                    a lottery/prize worth millions of rupees/dollars and the recipient only needs to click on 
                                    the link sent on their e-mail/mobile phone or to tell how they want to receive the prize 
                                    money. However, on responding positively, the recipient is asked to pay money in the 
                                    name of registration/shipment/service charges, GST etc. one after the other for releasing 
                                    the prize money. This way the recipient keeps on paying the fraudsters until he/she 
                                    realizes the fraud. The fraudsters were initially mainly from Nigeria and hence the 
                                    terminology.</p>

                                    <h4>precautions</h4>
                                    <ol><li>Never respond to calls/SMSs/e-mails related to winning a lottery/prize or seeking 
                                        personal or financial details. </li>
                                        <li>Have proper spam filters in your email account to stop receiving unsolicited 
                                        emails.</li> 
                                    <li>Follow the thumb rule: Never transfer funds to unknown persons or entities in

                                    <h3>ONLINE JOB FRAUD</h3>
                                    <p>Cyber criminals advertise fake job offers using various platforms either online via fake 
                                        websites. Victim, in search of a job, goes through these fake job offers and contacts the 
                                        cyber criminal. Upon contacting cyber criminals, victim is asked to pay registration fee 
                                        or make an advance payment (which they claim is refundable) to avail their services for 
                                        getting a job. Victim transfers the money and follows the guidelines of the fraudster for 
                                        getting a job and falls prey to the cyber crime. In some cases, a fake website phishes 
                                        financial data through a fake payment channel. </p>

                                            <li> Do not make any advance payments for getting a job.</li></ol>
                                 <h3>COMPUTER OR DEVICE HACKING</h3>
                                 <p>Hacking is the act of gaining access to a computer/device without legal authorisation. 
                                    Cyber criminal uses various methods for hacking a victim‟s computer/device such as 
                                    infecting a computer/device by a virus or malware. Hacking may lead to data 
                                    corruption/deletion or data loss or stealing of data. </p>

                                    <h4>precautions</h4>
                                    <ol><li>Computers/laptops should have a firewall and antivirus installed, enabled and 
                                        updated with latest versions. </li>
                                        <li>Never download or install pirated software, applications etc. on your computer, 
                                        laptops or hand- held devices.</li> 
                                        <li>Always scan external devices for viruses, while connecting to the computer. </li>
                                        <li> Be careful while browsing through a public Wi-Fi and avoid logging in to personal 
                                        and professional accounts while using public Wi-Fi systems. </li></ol>
                                <h3>MOBILE APPLICATIONS FRAUD</h3>
                               <p>Mobile applications may be mediums of cyber-attacks, stealing of confidential data or 
                                mode of getting access to the controls of your phone/device. People download mobile 
                                applications from unknown sources ignoring security warnings. These applications may 
                                have viruses which pass sensitive information or give control of your phone/device to 
                                some outside agent, who gets access to your contacts, passwords, financial data etc. 
                                Several mobile applications from unknown sources ask for unnecessary permissions for 
                                access to your phone/device, which one grants without due diligence. Thus, these mobile 
                                applications can access a huge amount of personal information, photographs etc. from 
                                your phone/device. </p>

                               <ol><li>Always install applications from trusted sources like for Android devices, use 
                                Google Play, for Apple devices use App Store. Please ensure that the app is 
                                having Play Protect shield.</li> 
                            <li> It is also important to read reviews about the app. If it has a negative review, read 
                                more to see if anybody noted any security concerns like bugs or unencrypted 
                                passwords. </li>
                            <li>Update your software and mobile applications on a regular basis so that you don‟t 
                                miss on important security patches. </li>
                            <li>Be careful while granting app permissions like a document scanning app does not 
                                require permission to access your location, call logs etc. Sometimes applications 
                                are filled with spyware and other types of malware. </li></ol>
