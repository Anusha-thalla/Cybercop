                 <h3>FRAUD USING FAKE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT</h3> 
                    <p>Fraudsters target accounts on popular social media platforms like Facebook and 
                     Instagram. They commit fraud by creating a similar fake account of the target profile and 
                     requesting his/her friends for instant money transfer citing some medical emergency etc. 
                     Target profile‟s friends transfer the money considering him/her as his/her friend. By the 
                     time the target profile comes to know of it, many of his friends become victims of the 
                     fraud. Similar fraud is also committed by hacking the target account. </p>

                     <h4>precautions</h4>
                     <ol><li> Keep the privacy setting as “My friends” only.</li> 
                         <li> Before transferring the money requested via Facebook, WhatsApp or other social 
                         media account, verify the authenticity of the message by meeting the concerned 
                         person or calling him.</li> 
                         <li> Turn on 2-step verification for all your social media accounts.</li> 
                         <li> Keep your password strong and maintain the privacy of the password. </li></ol>                     
                    <h3>SEXTORTION ON FACEBOOK</h3>
                    <p>Live video chat is done on Facebook via Messenger by cyber criminals posing as female. 
                     Cyber criminals convince the victim for video call in compromising positions, following 
                     which fraudsters take screenshots of the same or do screen recording of the video call. 
                     Cyber criminals then threaten the victim to circulate the photographs/videos in 
                     compromising positions on various online platforms, if the demanded money is not paid. </p>
                     <img src="page-0016.jpg">
                     <h4>precautions</h4>
                     <ol><li>Avoid friendship with unknown people on social media platforms. </li>
                         <li> Never make video calls to unknown people on Facebook or any other social media 
                         platform. </li></ol>
                     <h3>HARASSMENT THROUGH FAKE SOCIAL 
                         MEDIA PROFILES</h3> 
                     <p>Cyber criminals morph the photographs of the victim which they get from social media 
                         and upload it on social media platforms. After that they demand money to remove the 
                         morphed pictures from social media. Victim falls prey to the trap and transfers the 
                         money.</p>

                             friends.</li> 
                             <li> Refrain from making friendship with unknown persons over social media 
                             platforms. </li></ol>

                         media, messaging platforms, gaming platforms etc. It is a sort of repeated behaviour, aimed 
                         . at scaring, angering or shaming those who are targeted. Examples include: spreading lies 
                         about or posting embarrassing photos of someone on social media, sending hurtful

                             <li> Make your children aware that cyber bullying is a punishable crime so that neither 
                             do they indulge in cyber bullying nor do they let anyone bully them.</li> 
                             <li>Report hurtful comments, messages and photos and request to the concerned 
                             Social Media Platforms to remove them. Besides „unfriending‟, you can 
                             completely block people to stop them from seeing your profile or contacting you. </li></ol>
